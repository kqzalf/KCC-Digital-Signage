github intergration for screenly

drop your images into their respective folders.

1 image per folder at a time
use different names for images(put date or something unique like that)
no spaces in image names

* use an apache server with php to host assets
* point screenly viewers to asset pages
* use a cronjob to do pulls from github every 30 minutes

*use github to update things, the desktop app is really simple.

so the workflow is create/edit image>press two buttons(commit and push)>screens update

should update company wide :)
